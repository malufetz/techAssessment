sample XML parser and map display using UIMapkit

XML data is being parse using an open source lib which is  touch XML. touch XML is more handy than NSXMLparser. i used mapkitView to display the business location in the map using the lat and long given in the xml data.

XML is not easy to be pasre, XML requires different lib depending on the situation (large or small XML document).
